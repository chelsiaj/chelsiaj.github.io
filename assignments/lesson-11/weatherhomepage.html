            <h1 class="headlines">Warnings due to snowfall</h1>
            <h2>Marie Rodriguez</h2>   
            <p>
                In preston, the Department of Transportation warned that visibility was less than a half-mile in many locations due to snow and wind.
                Some spots in preston could see as much as 8-12 inches of snow, according to the National Weather Service.

                   And in preston, where snow was starting to pile up, authorities warned drivers to give plows extra room.

                   The governors of New York and Pennsylvania declared emergencies for their states, which were squarely in the path of the storm. 
                   New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a travel ban on tractor-trailers and buses on the Thruway and other interstate highways in the state beginning Saturday afternoon.

                   <br>
                   The weather service in Albany, New York, said snow could fall at a rate of 1 to 3 inches an hour, 
                   creating “difficult to impossible travel conditions” in areas.

                   "Our plows travel at a maximum speed of 35 mph," said Jordan Guerrein, spokesman for the state Department of Transportation. 
                   "People need to give them some room to work, they're big and heavy and often spreading salt. As we always say 'don't crowd the plow.'"
